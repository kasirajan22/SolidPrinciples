-   **S** - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change.
-   **O** - Open-Closed Principle (OCP): A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
-   **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes.
-   **I** - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): A client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use.
-   **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions.
